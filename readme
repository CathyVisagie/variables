Follow these steps:
● Create a JavaScript file called myVariables.js.
● Create the following variables with the correct data types (as indicated by
their names) as their values. You can choose the values themselves:
myFirstNumber, mySecondNumber, myFirstString, mySecondString and
myBoolean.
● Output the result of multiplying the two numerical variables.
● Concatenate the two strings and output the result.
● Using template literals, output a multiline string which might read as
follows:
The boolean is: true
The first number is: 6
The second number is: 5
6 x 5 = 30
The first string is: This is my first string.
The second string is: This is my second string!
These two together make: This is my first string. This is my
second string!
